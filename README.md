# SmoothOperator0
Ver 0, minimal reusability, but examples are reproducible.
If in any example, a _mex file does not exist, please enable the block of code that does the codegen to get mex files.
RunExamples.m runs the examples presented in the paper. A "objfun_xx not defined" error implies codegen has to be enabled in the relevant file.
